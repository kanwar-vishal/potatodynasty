        China has a history of more than four thousand years, and the Chinese
         people have established a colorful culture;<br> Chinese cuisine is an
          indispensable part of it. Most foreign travelers to China are deeply
           impressed by its food.<br> Here is a general introduction to Chinese
           cuisine and cooking culture.
         </p>

         <p>
           Chinese cuisine emphasizes the<b> integrity of color, fragrance and
            taste </b>in its food. Chinese chefs try to make dishes<br> beautiful by
            coordinating their colors. Some dishes are plain while others can
             be very bright. A table of Chinese food looks <br>very colorful and
            attractive.

              <b>Fragrance</b>--the way Chinese food smells--is very important.
              Chefs use the ingredients of a dish, as well as herbs, to make
               food<br> smell good. But, taste is the most distinct characteristic
                of Chinese food. Different methods are adopted to make Chinese
                food <br>delicious, which gives the tongue a lot of satisfaction.

                delicacies are; and no we aren't talking about the authentic
                Chinese food.<br> Here, we are referring to the Indianised version
                 of the Chinese cuisine. The addition of extravagant flavours
                 in schezwan rice,<br> noodles, vegetable and paneer make the Indo-
                 Chinese delicacies special. Interestingly, no Chinese person
                would be able to identify <br>these dishes as their own, most of
                   which appear to be made from a mix of soya sauce, chili sauce
                   , tomato ketchup and schezwan<br> sauce. These dishes developed
                    right here in our country only to satisfy our palates that
                    love hot and spicy food. Authentic or<br> not, the food has
                     definitely grasped our taste buds and refuses to let go.
